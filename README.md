# Research Paper Framework & Methodology Guide

A comprehensive, practical guide for conducting rigorous academic research and writing high-quality theses, particularly tailored for Master's students in Engineering and Applied Sciences.

## Overview

This framework provides a structured approach to research that emphasizes the **iterative nature** of the research process. Whether you're starting your first research project or refining your methodology, this guide offers detailed, actionable steps from topic identification through thesis defense.

## Who Is This For?

- **Master's students** in Engineering, particularly Mechanical Engineering and Embedded Systems
- **Early-stage researchers** learning systematic research methods
- **Anyone conducting experimental or simulation-based research**
- **Students preparing for thesis defense**
- **Researchers seeking to improve reproducibility and rigor**

The framework is adaptable to other STEM fields with minor modifications.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **6 Major Phases**: From problem identification to defense preparation
- **Iterative Process Model**: Acknowledges the non-linear nature of real research
- **Quality Checkpoints**: Self-assessment questions at each stage
- **Common Pitfalls**: Learn what mistakes to avoid before making them

### Modern Research Practices
- Open science and reproducibility guidelines
- Statistical rigor and avoiding common errors (p-hacking, HARKing)
- Ethical AI use in research
- Data management best practices
- Version control and documentation

### Practical Tools
- **Timeline management** for 2-year Master's programs
- **Complete thesis structure** template
- **Writing best practices** with do's and don'ts
- **Software recommendations** for each research phase
- **Peer review response** strategies

### Engineering-Focused
- Hardware and software integration guidance
- Experimental design (DOE techniques)
- Measurement uncertainty and error analysis
- System architecture for mechatronics projects
- Validation strategies for prototypes
